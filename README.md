Notes upon completion:
Managed to recreate the majority (Card, Sidebar and MenuPreview) in generic React components.
Move styling from app.css into styled components for each component to make it more efficient and easier to read.

Did not manage to recreate the menu summary into a React component within the 2 hours given. however I would go about doing this the same way as I have for the other components
I did not manage to write the tests in the time limit either, for this I had to spend a bit of time getting my head around react-testing-library and jest.
However I did decide that it would be good practice for myself to write the tests that I have, even in the time after the 2 hours
